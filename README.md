# Recycling-app

Congressional App Challenge

Recycling not only reduces the amount of waste that is sent to landfills but also conserves natural resources. Being able to throw trash away is very beneficial to the environment. To make it easier to do this, I created this website! With this website, you are able to be certain of you trash and recycling pickup schedules. It's as simple as typing in your address and you will be able to view the dates. This can optimize your trash routine with ease. This website also allows you to input an item and it will tell you what bin to put it in. This tool is useful because of the new compost bin that adds another option(add different word than option). For example if you don't know which bin to put your banana peels into, you can type it in and it will tell you to put it in the compost bin. (This is powered by AI...)
For specific materials such as electronics, batteries, glass, or plastic, This Website will show a map of nearby recycling center that will accept those items.
For even more information about waste reduction tips, this website will include articles, videos, and infographics on topics such as minimizing single-use plastics, composting, upcycling, repurposing, and creative ways to reduce waste in everyday life.

Steps to build Recyling App:

Make the design for the web application UI

    Trash collection schedule lookup
    Call the San Diego trash API

    Area to input item(s) and it will tell you how to recycle it
    Using an API or AI

    If it the item, for exmple batteries, does not fall in one of the categories(Trash, Recycle, or Compost) then it will list nearby recycling centers.

    Composting information
    articles, videos, and infographics on topics such as minimizing single-use plastics, composting, upcycling, repurposing.
