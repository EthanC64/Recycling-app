    <h2>About the Recycling App</h2>
    <p>
      Recycling not only reduces the amount of waste that is sent to landfills
      but also conserves natural resources. Being able to throw trash away is
      very beneficial to the environment. To make it easier to do this, I
      created this website! With this website, you are able to be certain of
      you trash and recycling pickup schedules. It's as simple as typing in
      your address and you will be able to view the dates. This can optimize
      your trash routine with ease. This website also allows you to input an
      item and it will tell you what bin to put it in. This tool is useful
      because of the new compost bin that adds another option(add different
      word than option). For example if you don't know which bin to put your
      banana peels into, you can type it in and it will tell you to put it in
      the compost bin. For specific materials such as electronics, batteries,
      glass, or plastic, This Website will show a map of nearby recycling
      center that will accept those items. For even more information about
      waste reduction tips, this website will include articles, videos, and
      infographics on topics such as minimizing single-use plastics,
      composting, upcycling, repurposing, and creative ways to reduce waste in
      everyday life.
